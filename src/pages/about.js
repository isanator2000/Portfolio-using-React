        <p>This text is temporary, as I'm only writing this as a placeholder while I actually come up with something interesting.
            I put a lot of effort into making this assignment! I know it's not that pretty but I'm kinda proud of myself.
            I'll come back to it later to make improvements and turn it into a real, more professional portfolio as I'm sure it'll be of use.
            Thanks for visiting anyway!
